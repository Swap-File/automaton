// This technique uses the PWM peripheral on the NRF52. The PWM uses the
// EasyDMA feature included on the chip. This technique loads the duty
// cycle configuration for each cycle when the PWM is enabled. For this
// to work we need to store a 16 bit configuration for each bit of the
// RGB(W) values in the pixel buffer.
// Comparator values for the PWM were hand picked and are guaranteed to
// be 100% organic to preserve freshness and high accuracy. Current
// parameters are:
//   * PWM Clock: 16Mhz
//   * Minimum step time: 62.5ns
//   * Time for zero in high (T0H): 0.31ms
//   * Time for one in high (T1H): 0.75ms
//   * Cycle time:  1.25us
//   * Frequency: 800Khz
// For 400Khz we just double the calculated times.
// ---------- BEGIN Constants for the EasyDMA implementation -----------
// The PWM starts the duty cycle in LOW. To start with HIGH we
// need to set the 15th bit on each register.

// WS2812 (rev A) timing is 0.35 and 0.7us
//#define MAGIC_T0H               5UL | (0x8000) // 0.3125us
//#define MAGIC_T1H              12UL | (0x8000) // 0.75us

// If there is no device available an alternative cycle-counter
// implementation is tried.
// The nRF52 runs with a fixed clock of 64Mhz. The alternative
// implementation is the same as the one used for the Teensy 3.0/1/2 but
// with the Nordic SDK HAL & registers syntax.

  // midpoint, not start, of pure cyan). The 8-bit RGB hexcone (256 values
  // each for red, green, blue) really only allows for 1530 distinct hues
  // (not 1536, more on that below), but the full unsigned 16-bit type was
  // chosen for hue so that one's code can easily handle a contiguous color
  // wheel by allowing hue to roll over in either direction.

  // costly modulo operator, 1530 is handled as a special case below.

  // So you'd think that the color "hexcone" (the thing that ramps from
  // pure red, to pure yellow, to pure green and so forth back to red,
  // yielding six slices), and with each color component having 256
  // possible values (0-255), might have 1536 possible items (6*256),
  // but in reality there's 1530. This is because the last element in
  // each 256-element slice is equal to the first element of the next
  // slice, and keeping those in there this would create small
  // discontinuities in the color wheel. So the last element of each
  // slice is dropped...we regard only elements 0-254, with item 255
  // being picked up as element 0 of the next slice. Like this:
  // Red to not-quite-pure-yellow is:        255,   0, 0 to 255, 254,   0
  // Pure yellow to not-quite-pure-green is: 255, 255, 0 to   1, 255,   0
  // Pure green to not-quite-pure-cyan is:     0, 255, 0 to   0, 255, 254
  // and so forth. Hence, 1530 distinct hues (0 to 1529), and hence why
  // the constants below are not the multiples of 256 you might expect.
